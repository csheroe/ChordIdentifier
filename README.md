# ChordIdentifier
Small web app built for undergrad Capstone project enabling new guitarists to find major and minor chord patterns (triads) on the fretboard. Built with the classics, HTML, JS, PHP, mySQL, and Bootstrap. 
Example output encased in images of an A minor chord (that consists of a triad, or 3 notes while the bottom three strings are muted), and an F-Sharp Minor chord (in which all 6 strings are being played). Should probably fix that CSS padding huh?
